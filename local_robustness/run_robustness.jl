# run_experiment.jl
#
# This driver script runs experiments by loading an input phase-space matrix,
# generating graph states, applying Hadamard and T operations in different orders,
# and evaluating the robustness of the resulting states.
#
# Two modes are supported:
#
#   :mbqc       -> These are resource states arising from a reduction technique used in mbqc.
#                       Graph states are generated first (from |+âŸ©^n). Then, 
#                       Hadamard gates are applied to selected qubits followed by 
#                       T gates. The state is converted to a density matrix and 
#                       then its Pauli expansion is computed.
#
#   :pbc        -> These are resource states arising from a reduction technique used in pbc.   
#                       A magic state is prepared by applying T gates (t_state).
#                       Then, for each hadamard pattern, Hadamard actions are applied
#                       directly on the T gate (i.e. on the magic state), and then 
#                       entanglement is generated via CZ operations.
#
# Results are saved to HDF5 files.
