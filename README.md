# Introduction

This This is the GitHub repository companion to [Okay, et al. 2024] "Classical simulation of universal measurement-based quantum computation using multipartite Bell scenarios" by Okay, YÃ¼cel, Ipek, [arXiv:2410.23734](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23734).

## Background

Among the central contributions of arXiv:2410.23734 is a probabilistic representation of Measurement-Based Pauli Computation (MBPC), a variant of Measurement-Based Quantum Computing (MBQC) that uses single-qubit Pauli measurements and is also universal; see e.g., [[Danos, et al. 2006]](https://arxiv.org/abs/0704.1263), [[Raussendorf, et al. 2017]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08506).

Since MBPC is driven by single-qubit Pauli measurements, the computation does not initiate on a graph state, as this would only compute stabilizer circuits. Rather, we use a resource state, called a *magic cluster state*, which is a modification of a graph state that exhibits both entanglement and non-stabilizerness. Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ on $n$ vertices and a subset $U\subset V$, an $n$-qubit magic cluster state in the $n$-qubit Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_n = (\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes n}$ is defined by

$$\left |\psi_{G,U} \right \rangle = E(G)T^{\otimes U} \left |+ \right \rangle^{\otimes n}\quad \text{where}\quad E(G) = \prod_{(i,j)\in E}CZ_{ij}$$

The central objects of our classical simulation algorithm are the Local Pauli (LP) polytope, convex geometric structures that enclose the set of quantum states; including magic cluste states. The $n$-qubit LP polytope, denoted $\text{LP}_n$, can be identified with $\text{NS}_n$, the non-signaling polytopes of the (n,3,2) multi-partite Bell scenario for all $n$.

An important structural property of LP polytopes is that they are closed under the tensor product operation familiar from quantum mechanics. In particular, for a vertex $A_1\in \text{LP}_{n_1}$ and vertex $A_2\in \text{LP}_{n_2}$ we have that $A_1\otimes A_2$ is a vertex of $\text{LP}_{n_1+n_2}$.

In [Okay, et al. 2024] a distinguished class of operators, called *locally closed (LC)* operators, was introduced. Two Pauli operators are said to *locally commute* if they commute on every tensor factor. A subset of Pauli operators is said to be locally closed if for every two locally commuting Pauli operators $A$ and $B$ in that subset, then their product $A\cdot B$ is also in the subset. For a single qubit $\text{LP}_1$ is a cube enclosing the Bloch sphere whose vertices are LC operators. The $n$-fold tensor product of $\text{LP}_1$ vertices is an LC operator that is always a vertex of $\text{LP}_n$ and can be identified with the deterministic vertices of $\text{NS}_n$; i.e., the vertices of the Bell polytope. Interestingly, the vertices of $\text{LP}_2$, the two-qubit LP polytope also consists only of LC operators. Thus the tensor product of $\text{LP}_1$ and $\text{LP}_2$ vertices is also locally closed. 

LC operators with efficient representation (in $n$) and update rules can be organized into a phase space that can be used for classical simulation based on sampling from a quasi-probability distribution. The LC phase space subsumes the phase space introduced in [[Raussendorf, et al. 2017]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05374) based on closed non-contextual (CNC) sets, which itself generalizes the stabilizer phase space of (Howard and Campbell, 2016). Some examples of LC phase spaces include:

- $D$:$\quad$ Deterministic vertices; i.e., vertices of the $(n,3,2)$ Bell polytope.
- $L$:$\quad$ Tensor product of $\text{LP}_1$ and $\text{LP}_2$ vertices,
- $L'$:$\quad$ Deterministic vertices and the $n$-qubit CNC operators.

For any phase space we can define a robustness monotone:

$$\mathfrak{R}(\rho) := \min \left\{\sum_{\alpha\in V} |Q(\alpha)|~:~\rho = \sum_{\alpha\in V} Q(\alpha) A_\alpha \right\},$$

where $\alpha \in V$ labels the operators in the phase space.


## Code contents


In this GitHub repository we provide the $L_1$ and $L_2$ phase space operators for $n=3$ and deterministic vertices for $n=3,4,5$. We encode the phase spaces in matrices whose columns are labeled by $\alpha \in V$ and whose rows are Pauli coefficients of the corresponding operator $A_\alpha$. In particular, for some phase space operator $A_\alpha$ and a Pauli $P$, the matrix has components $M_{P,\alpha} = \text{Tr}(PA_\alpha) $.  We employ lexicographic ordering on the rows so that $I\otimes \cdots \otimes I$ precedes $I\otimes \cdots \otimes X$, which precedes $I\otimes \cdots \otimes Y$, and so on.

Our matrices have size:

**Three-qubits**

- $D$:$\quad$ $64\times 512$
- $L$:$\quad$ $64\times 27,008$
- $L'$:$\quad$ $64\times 71,648$


In the directory **libs** we have basic functionality for manipulating Pauli operators. The directory **local_robustness** has functions for computing the robustness for the $D$, $L_1$, and $L_2$ phase spaces, as well as the CNC phase space. We compute the robustness for two families of resource states

\begin{align}
\text{PBC~:}\quad &     \left |\psi_{G,U}^{PBC} \right \rangle = E(G)H^{\otimes U}T^{\otimes 3} \left |+++ \right \rangle,\notag\\
\text{MBQC:}\quad &     \left |\psi_{G,U}^{MBQC} \right \rangle =T^{\otimes 3} H^{\otimes U}E(G) \left |+++ \right \rangle,\notag
\end{align}

where $U$ runs over all possible subsets of $\{1,2,3\}$ and $G$ runs over all connected graphs on $3$ qubits.
